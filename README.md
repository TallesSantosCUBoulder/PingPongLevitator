# PID Controlled Ping Pong Ball Levitation

## Introduction
  This experiment of the Ping Pong Levitator aims to demonstrate how a PID (Proportional, Integral, and Derivative) controller works and how each of the variables affects the height of the ping pong ball. Using control systems to balance the input with the actual versus the desired output, the creation and use of the levitator serves as a physical display of how these controllers can be utilized in almost every field of engineering. 

- PID controller
